# Regression-analysis
This is a regression analysis example based on the Python language (only simple regression analysis, without involving machine learning content).

In this repository, I will introduce the Python code used in the CASA0007 course, covering data cleaning, regression analysis, model validation, and data visualization. In two case studies, I utilized the sklearn package to perform multiple linear regression and multivariate logistic regression, achieving regression analysis and data visualization.
